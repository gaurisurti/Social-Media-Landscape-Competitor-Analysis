Orville Redenbacher's Analysisâ€‹- Social Media Landscape &amp; Competitor Analysis
As part of the Orville team, we led efforts to enhance the company's content strategy and customer engagement. Through research and a social media audit, we identified key issues: inconsistent brand tonality, lack of scheduled posts and themes, irregular dormant periods, and ineffective use of hashtags.

To address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive 3x3+1 social media strategy centered around Orville's objectives and key content categories. We created a content calendar that capitalized on seasonality and relevant events to ensure consistent messaging.

The project's goal was to enhance Orville's content strategy by identifying the most effective content types, channels, influencers, and trends. Through in-depth competitor analysis and social media insights, we gained valuable understanding of our target market and successful engagement strategies.

Our strategy prioritized active engagement, effective reputation management, and meaningful conversations with our audience. We aimed to align our efforts with Conagra Brand standards and foster ongoing dialogue through our social media channels.

We successfully executed the strategy, resulting in notable improvements in brand tonality, increased engagement levels, and a stronger online presence for Orville. These achievements were a testament to the effectiveness of our approach and the value we delivered to the company.As part of the Orville team, we led efforts to enhance the company's content strategy and customer engagement.
